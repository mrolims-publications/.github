  **Abstract:** The discrimination between order and chaos in dynamical systems remains a central problem in the field. Among the most widely used indicators are the Smaller Alignment Index (SALI), the Generalized Alignment Index (GALI), and the Linear Dependence Index (LDI), all of which exploit the evolution of deviation vectors to distinguish regular from chaotic motion. In this paper, we first show analytically, and confirm numerically, that the decay rates of LDI for chaotic orbits in both discrete- and continuous-time systems are the same with those of GALI reported in the literature. Our derivations, however, are more accessible, relying on the Singular Value Decomposition rather than the wedge-product formulation of GALI, which involves volumes of higher-dimensional parallelepipeds. We then derive the analytical expression for the decay rate of SALI in chaotic maps, demonstrating that it depends on the difference of the two largest Lyapunov exponents, as previously established for continuous-time systems. Crucially, we show analytically that the second Lyapunov exponent must always be considered, independent of its sign, in order to capture correctly the decay of SALI. This contrasts with existing results for continuous systems, where the second exponent is greater or equal than zero for chaotic orbits. Our analytical and numerical findings, therefore, extend the SALI decay rate formula to both continuous- and discrete-time systems. Finally, we confirm numerically that the decay rate of the SALI for chaotic maps is accurately described by our formula, which incorporates the two largest Lyapunov exponents, regardless of whether the second exponent is positive, zero, or negative.

- **[Transport mechanisms associated with non-integer wavenumbers in a discontinuous nontwist map](https://github.com/mrolims-publications/transport-noninteger-wavenumber)**  
  _Authors: M. R. Sales, M. Mugnaine, A. L. R. de Moraes, E. D. Leonel, C. G. Antonopoulos, I. L. Caldas, J. D. Szezech Jr._  
  [![DOI](https://img.shields.io/badge/DOI-10.1016%2Fj.chaos.2025.116966-blue)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2025.116966)
  
  **Abstract:** The transport properties in two-dimensional, area-preserving mappings are deeply influenced by the phase space structures such as invariant tori, cantori, and manifold crossings. For nontwist maps, the presence or absence of the shearless invariant curve dictates whether the map exhibits global transport. In this paper, we investigate the extended standard nontwist map, which consists of the standard nontwist map perturbed by a secondary wavenumber *m*. We explore the transport and behavior of chaotic orbits for arbitrary real *m*. Our results confirm that the twin island chain scenario only holds for odd integer *m*, and reveal that the probability of chaotic orbits crossing the central island chain is highly sensitive to *m*. We demonstrate that for certain , the manifold configuration is such that only unidirectional transport is achieved, either upward or downward, or heteroclinic orbits from the primary resonances are suppressed entirely, significantly reducing the transport. Additionally, we identify a narrow interval of *m* for which the shearless curve reemerges, preventing transport altogether. Our findings are supported by detailed and high-precision numerical analysis of the stable and unstable manifolds and their intra and intercrossing structures

- **[Shrinking shrimp-shaped domains and multistability in the dissipative asymmetric kicked rotor map](https://github.com/mrolims-publications/dissipative-asymmetric-stdmap)**  
  _Authors: M. R. Sales, M. Mugnaine, E. D. Leonel, I. L. Caldas, and J. D. Szezech Jr._  
  [![DOI](https://img.shields.io/badge/DOI-10.1063%2F5.0233324-blue)](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0233324)

  **Abstract**: An interesting feature in dissipative nonlinear systems is the emergence of characteristic domains in parameter space that exhibit periodic temporal evolution, known as shrimp-shaped domains. We investigate the parameter space of the dissipative asymmetric kicked rotor map and show that, in the regime of strong dissipation, the shrimp-shaped domains repeat themselves as the nonlinearity parameter increases while maintaining the same period. We analyze the dependence of the length of each periodic domain with the nonlinearity parameter, revealing that it follows a power law with the same exponent regardless of the dissipation parameter. Additionally, we find that the distance between adjacent shrimp-shaped domains is scaling invariant with respect to the dissipation parameter. Furthermore, we show that for weaker dissipation, a multistable scenario emerges within the periodic domains. We find that as the dissipation gets weaker, the ratio of multistable parameters for each periodic domain increases, and the area of the periodic basin decreases as the nonlinearity parameter increases.

- **[An investigation of escape and scaling properties of a billiard system](https://github.com/mrolims-publications/tunable-billiard)**  
  _Authors: M. R. Sales, D. Borin, D. R. da Costa, J. D. Szezech Jr., and E. D. Leonel_  
  [![DOI](https://img.shields.io/badge/DOI-10.1063%2F5.0222215-blue)](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0222215)

  **Abstract**: We investigate some statistical properties of escaping particles in a billiard system whose boundary is described by two control parameters with a hole on its boundary. Initially, we analyze the survival probability for different hole positions and sizes. We notice that the survival probability follows an exponential decay with a characteristic power-law tail when the hole is positioned partially or entirely over large stability islands in phase space. We find that the survival probability exhibits scaling invariance with respect to the hole size. In contrast, the survival probability for holes placed in predominantly chaotic regions deviates from the exponential decay. We introduce two holes simultaneously and investigate the complexity of the escape basins for different hole sizes and control parameters by means of the basin entropy and the basin boundary entropy. We find a non-trivial relation between these entropies and the system’s parameters and show that the basin entropy exhibits scaling invariance for a specific control parameter interval.

- **[Ratchet current and scaling properties in a nontwist mapping](https://github.com/mrolims-publications/nontwist-dynamical-system)**  
  _Authors: M. R. Sales, D. Borin, L. C. de Souza, J. D. Szezech Jr., R. L. Viana, I. L. Caldas, and E. D. Leonel_  
  [![DOI](https://img.shields.io/badge/DOI-10.1016%2Fj.chaos.2024.115614-blue)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2024.115614)

  **Abstract**: We investigate the transport of particles in the chaotic component of phase space for a two-dimensional, area-preserving nontwist map. The survival probability for particles within the chaotic sea is described by an exponential decay for regions in phase space predominantly chaotic and it is scaling invariant in this case. Alternatively, when considering mixed chaotic and regular regions, there is a deviation from the exponential decay, characterized by a power law tail for long times, a signature of the stickiness effect. Furthermore, due to the asymmetry of the chaotic component of phase space with respect to the line *I = 0*, there is an unbalanced stickiness that generates a ratchet current in phase space. Finally, we perform a phenomenological description of the diffusion of chaotic particles by identifying three scaling hypotheses, and obtaining the critical exponents via extensive numerical simulations.

- **[Stickiness and recurrence plots: an entropy based approach](https://github.com/mrolims-publications/StickinessRecurrencePlots)**  
  _Authors: M. R. Sales, M. Mugnaine, J. Szezech, José D., R. L. Viana, I. L. Caldas, N. Marwan, and J. Kurths_  
  [![DOI](https://img.shields.io/badge/DOI-10.1063%2F5.0140613-blue)](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0140613)

  **Abstract**: The stickiness effect is a fundamental feature of quasi-integrable Hamiltonian systems. We propose the use of an entropy-based measure of the recurrence plots (RPs), namely, the entropy of the distribution of the recurrence times (estimated from the RP), to characterize the dynamics of a typical quasi-integrable Hamiltonian system with coexisting regular and chaotic regions. We show that the recurrence time entropy (RTE) is positively correlated to the largest Lyapunov exponent, with a high correlation coefficient. We obtain a multi-modal distribution of the finite-time RTE and find that each mode corresponds to the motion around islands of different hierarchical levels.
